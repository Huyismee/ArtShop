# ArtShop

this is a small project using both Nodejs and .Net to create API and Frontend

# Technology used:
 - .Net backend: .Net 8, EF core, SQL Server, Bearer JWT.
 - NodeJS backend: ExpressJS, Prisma, jsonwebtoken, dotenv.
 - Frontend: .Net 8, Razorpage, Flurl, ImageSharp.

# How to run:
 - Make sure to create Database first before running anything.
 - Launch 1 of the backend project, not both (both backend have the same port).
 - Open frontend project.

# Can Be Improved:
 - Could design more function for the API.
 - Could handle JWT more proficient (Refreshing the token,...).
 - .Net backend should have design more detail (using Design pattern) for better maintainability and scalability.
 - NodeJS backend still simple, and can be improved.
 - Create more function in backend (Edit, Delete Art, Edit User, View other user's profile).
 - Improve database in many ways for both art and user table.
